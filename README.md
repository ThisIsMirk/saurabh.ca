Making a website for my friend, Saurabh :) 

This website was made from scratch using HTML/CSS/JS. No templates were used, however, certain templates were used as inspiration for the design and layout.  

## @media screen
The biggest lesson here for me was making it all work on mobile. This is not something I did for my own website, but my friend made it clear that everything should work on mobile as intended as most visitors would be visiting the website through their phone (which is very true). I soon learned that creating a responsive web design was a very manual process and not a very fun one at that. Deliberate tuning of each element using @media screen was required but I figure more experienced web developers than I might have a streamlined approach to this whole process. 

## javascript and flex vs grid
Wrote a simple script that would call on the header to appear as the user scrolled past the name on top... javascript is a very strange language. Another script controlled the hide and show animation for the blocks of text as the user scrolled through. It was important here that I fine-tuned the duration and overall appearance of these animations so it didn't feel like too much was happening at the same time to the user's eyes.  

I used grid for the first time, mostly just to compare it with flex and see which one I prefer more... Well, I don't know yet.
